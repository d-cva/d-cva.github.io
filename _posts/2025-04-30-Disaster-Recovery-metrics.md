Disaster recovery planning is governed by a variety of metrics that express how reliable services are and how long it takes to recover from critical events.

High availability is a characteristic of a system that can guarantee a certain level of availability.

Maximum tolerable Downtime(MTD) metric states the requirement for a business function. Downtime is calculated from the sum of scheduled service intervals (Agreed service Time) plus unplanned outages over the period. High availability might be implemented as 24X7 or 24 X 365. For critical system, availability will be described as two nines (99%) or up to five-or-six nines(99.9999%)

MTD sets the upper limit on the amount of recovery time that system should be recovered. The additional metrics can be used to govern recovery operations:
