<h1>Disaster Recovery Concepts</h1>

<strong>DRP (Disaster recovery plan)</strong> addresses large-scale network outage incidents. These will typically be incidents that threaten the performance or security of a whole site.
- Identify scenarios for natural and non-natural disasters and options for protecting systems.
- Identify tasks, resources and responsibilities for responding to a disaster. 
- Train staff in the disaster planning procedures and how to react will to adverse events.

Testing system resilience and incident  response effectiveness are crucial for organizations to recover from disruption and maintain business continuity.

<h2>Tabletop exercises:</h2>
- This involves team discussion to overcome the possible outage and how to recover or restore services in those situations. These exercise helps to identify knowledge, communication and coordination gaps, ultimately strengthening the organizationâ€™s incident response capabilities.

<h2>Validation tests:</h2>
- Validation test involves creating simulations of failover and test the applied solutions on a test environment to validate the recovery is full proof and also check the metric time for service restore. These tests allow to understand about the unexpected errors or situations that can potentially happen during recovery. 
Business continuity plan (BCP) or Continuity of operations plan (COOP) is a collection of processes and resources that enables the organization to maintain normal business operations in the face of some adverse event. 

continuity planning activity focuses on the functions performed by a business or other organization:
- <strong>Business impact analysis (BIA)</strong> identifies mission essential and primary business function and the risks that would arise if the organization cannot fulfill them.
- <strong>IT contingency planning (ITCP) </strong> or<strong> IT service continuity planning (ITSCP)</strong> ensures that these functions are supported by resilient IT systems, working to identify and mitigate all single points of failure from a process or function.
