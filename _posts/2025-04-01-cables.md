<h1>Supporting Cabling and Physical Installation</h1>
<h2>Network Data Transmission</h2>
- Network data transfer works by modulating the properties of a transmission medium, electric current, infrared light, or radio waves to encode a signal

- Each media type supports a range of possible frequencies. Higher frequencies allow for more data to be transferred per second. The range of frequencies is referred to as the media bandwidth.
<h2>Ethernet Standards</h2>
- The institue of electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sets the standards
- 802.3 Ethernet standards are very widely used on both LANs and WANs
- Ethernet standards provide assurance that network cabling will meet the bandwidth requirements of applications. 
- The ethernet media specifications are named using a three-part convention, which is often referred to as xBASE-y.
    - The speed or bit rate in megabits per second (MBPS) or gigabits per second
    - The signal mode (baseband or broadband). all mainstream types of Ethernet use baseband transmissions, so you will only see specifications of the form xBASE-y
    - A designator for the media type

<h2>Media Access Control and Collision Domains</h2>
Media access control (MAC) refers to the methods a network technology uses to determine when nodes can communicate on shared media and to deal with possible problems, such as two devices attempting to communicate simultaneously.

Collision domains:

A collision domain is, as the name implies, the part of a network where packet collisions can occur. A collision occurs when two devices send a packet at the same time on the shared network segment. https://study-ccna.com/collision-broadcast-domain/

The ethernet protocol governing contention and media access is called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). A collision is the state when a signal is present on an interface’s transmit and receives lines simultaneously. On detecting a collision, the node broadcasts a jam signal. Each node that was attempting to use the media then waits for a random period before attempting to transmit again. 

The collision detection mechanism means that only half-duplex transmission is possible.

<h2>100BASE-TX Fast Ethernet Standards</h2>
The fast Ethernet standard uses the same CSMA/CD protocol as 10BASE-T but with higher frequency signaling an improved encoding methods, raising the bit rate from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. 100BASE-TX refers to fast ethernet working over Cat5 twisted pair copper cable with a maximum supported link length of 100 meters.

<h2>Gigabit Ethernet Standards</h2>
Gigabit Ethernet builds on the standards defined for Ethernet and fast Ethernet to implement rates of 1000 Mbps (1Gbps), when installed using Cat5e or better copper wire. Gigabit Ethernet is specified as 1000BASE-T. Gigabit Ethernet doesn’t support hubs; it is implemented only using switches. The maximum distance of 100 meters applies to cabling between the node and the switch port, or between two switch port.

Gigabit is supported by both copper cable and fiber, while copper wire can be cost effective and the fiber cable can be expensive.

10 Gigabit Ether (10GbE) multiplies the nominal speed of Gigabit Ethernet by a factor of 10. Because of the higher frequencies required, 10 GbE can only run at reduced distances over unshielded copper cables. For longer runs higher categories of copper wire with some type of shielding, or a fiber cable is required.
