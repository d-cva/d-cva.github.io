<h1>What is network?</h1>
- A network is two or more computers or the network enabled systems that are linked by a transmission medium and share one or more protocols that enable them to exchange data.

<h2>Client-Server vs Peer-to-peer Networks</h2>

<h3>Client-server node:</h3>

A client-server network is a network where some of the nodes are client and some nodes are server. The role of server is to provide some kind of service to the clients, it can be applications, database, web or any service. The role of client is to make use of the service provided by the server.

<h3>Peer-to Peer network:</h3>

Peer to peer is a decentralized network where the hosts acts as both client and server. This can aslo be referred to as a workgroup network.


<h4>Appliances:</h4>

An appliance is a computer with an operating system and software designed to perform a particular network role. EG: router switch, wireless access point.

Applications: - The nodes and links of networking infrastructure are deployed to run services. Services are shared applications that allow the network to do useful work, such as sharing files or allowing employees to send email.

Functions :-  Networks can be configured with additional properties to perform different functions. EG the security properties of a virtual private network allow devices to join a local network from across the internet.
